# Review:
### Breakdown of Code:
1. **Data Importing:** The code is reading a CSV file containing stock market data into a pandas DataFrame (`stock_df`).
    
2. **Feature Creation:**
    
    - **High-Low Percentage (`HL_PCT`):** It calculates the percentage difference between the highest price and the closing price.
    - **Percentage Change (`PCT_change`):** It calculates the percentage difference between the closing and opening prices.
3. **Data Cleaning:**
    
    - It drops unnecessary columns and keeps only the relevant ones: `Closing Price`, `HL_PCT`, `PCT_change`, and `Trading Volume`.
4. **Forecasting Setup:**
    
    - The `forecast_out` variable determines the number of rows to predict in the future (in this case, it's calculated based on the length of the data).
    - The target column (`Label`) is created by shifting the `Closing Price` column upward by `forecast_out` rows.
5. **Handling Missing Data:** The code includes a commented-out line to handle NaN values by filling them with a specific value (`-999999`). However, you are actually dropping rows with `NaN` values with `dropna()` in the next line.
    
6. **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    - **Removing Commas from `Trading Volume`:** The `Trading Volume` column contains commas, so the code removes them and converts the column to a numeric type (float).
7. **Feature Scaling:** The `X` array is scaled using `preprocessing.scale()`, which normalizes the feature set so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    
8. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    
    - A linear regression model (`clf`) is used to fit the data.
    - The model is trained on the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`), and its accuracy is evaluated on the test data (`X_test` and `y_test`).
9. **Saving the Model:** The model is saved using `joblib` (currently commented out).

### Suggestions for Improvement:

10. **Handling NaN Values:** Instead of using a hard-coded fill value (`-999999`), you could consider imputation methods such as forward fill, backward fill, or using the mean of the column. If there are only a few missing values, dropping them might be fine, but in a large dataset, imputation might be more efficient.
    
    ```python
    stock_df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Example for forward fill
    ```
    
11. **Feature Engineering:**
    
    - You might want to consider adding additional features (such as moving averages, volatility measures, etc.) to improve model performance.
    - You could also consider technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), or Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for enhanced prediction.
12. **Scaling Improvements:**
    
    - While you are scaling the features, it is good practice to apply the scaler to the test data using the same scaler fitted to the training data (to avoid data leakage). You can achieve this by fitting the scaler on the training set and then transforming both the training and test sets:
        
        ```python
        scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
        X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
        X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
        ```
        
13. **Model Evaluation:**
    
    - Linear Regression might not be the best model for stock price prediction since stock prices often follow non-linear patterns. You can try other models, like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even neural networks.
    - It might also be useful to evaluate the model's performance with more metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ² instead of just the accuracy.
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
    ```
    
14. **Time Series Cross Validation:**
    
    - Since stock data is time series data, it is better to use time series-specific cross-validation rather than random splits. You can use `TimeSeriesSplit` from `sklearn.model_selection` for this purpose.
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
    tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
    for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
        X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
        y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
        # Train and evaluate the model on this split
    ```
    

---

By improving feature engineering, scaling methods, and evaluating with more metrics, you could potentially improve the model's ability to predict stock prices.

# Question:
I have some questions about this code: 
15. why use `HL_PCT` and `PCT_change`? Why instead of using opening price and highest price directly, the teacher use these indexes? 
16. you said in `fillna` function, a better approach is to use forward fill, can you give me all three examples? forward fill, backward fill and mean of the column. 
17. explain the code `stock_df['Trading Volume'] = stock_df['Trading Volume'].replace({',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)`, mainly why did he use replace function like this? what is the parameters that was passed in? what is the return value of replace, that it can be followed by `.astype(float)`? for this function will it always occur like this where you replace something as float type? I want to understand how this function works, and I want to learn all about this function because this operation seems it's going to merge it self very often. 
18. The third improvement you mentioned, scaling improvements, what is the meaning of this? what do you mean by: "to apply the scaler to the test data using the same scaler fitted to the training data(to avoid data leakage)", i think the main problem here is that i don't really understand how .fit and .transform work, what is preprocessing? I know that this is not a function, but why it can be added a `.StandardScaler()`? and why can it add a `.fit()`? please explain this very thoroughly. 
19. The fourth improvement you mentioned, model evaluation, how do I determine whether or not to use linear regression to do this? How to identify which model should I use? And I noticed for linear regression, the accuracy of linear regression is normal distribution, and because of this, the score is really high, for example, the model predited the closing price as 6.7, the actual price is 6.3 which is considered correct for the program and not considered correct for me, how can I adjust the width of this normal distribution to adjust how much of this is considered correct?

# Answers:
### 1. Why use `HL_PCT` and `PCT_change` instead of directly using the `Opening Price` and `Highest Price`?

- **HL_PCT (High-Low Percentage):**  
    This feature is calculated as the percentage difference between the highest price and the closing price. It provides insight into the daily volatility of a stock. In some cases, stock prices can swing between the opening and closing prices, and the high-low range often gives a better idea of price movement. The **HL_PCT** can act as a measure of the "spread" or "range" for the day, which might provide more meaningful input to the model compared to using just the opening or highest price directly.
    
- **PCT_change (Percentage Change):**  
    This feature shows the percentage difference between the closing and opening prices. It captures how much the price has changed during the trading day in relative terms, which is important to understand the stock's daily price movement. The teacher likely included this because it highlights how volatile the stock's price is and reflects daily trends that are predictive of future price movements.
    

Using these indicators allows the model to focus on the relationship between price changes rather than just absolute prices, making the model more sensitive to price fluctuations and trends. While the opening or highest prices might tell you some things, percentage-based features like **HL_PCT** and **PCT_change** can offer better relative measures of stock price dynamics.

### 2. `fillna` Methods: Forward Fill, Backward Fill, and Mean Imputation

Here are three ways to handle missing data:

20. **Forward Fill (`ffill`):**  
    This method replaces missing values with the previous non-null value in the column. It is useful when you assume that the previous value carries information for the next one.
    
    ```python
    stock_df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    ```
    
21. **Backward Fill (`bfill`):**  
    This method replaces missing values with the next non-null value. It's the reverse of forward fill, which might be useful when you believe the next value holds information for the current one.
    
    ```python
    stock_df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)
    ```
    
22. **Mean Imputation:**  
    This method fills missing values with the mean of the column. It is useful when the missing values are randomly distributed, and you assume the missing data points are close to the mean of the entire column.
    
    ```python
    stock_df.fillna(stock_df.mean(), inplace=True)
    ```
    

These methods are helpful when you have missing data that you'd like to replace. Which one to use depends on the nature of your data and the assumptions you're making about missing values.

### 3. Understanding `replace` and `.astype(float)` in `stock_df['Trading Volume']`

- **`replace({',': ''}, regex=True)` Explanation:**
    
    - The `replace` method is being used to remove commas from the `Trading Volume` column. In the stock data, the `Trading Volume` values may be stored with commas (e.g., "15,073"), which would be read as strings by pandas.
    - `replace({',': ''}, regex=True)` tells pandas to replace all commas (`,`) with an empty string (`''`).
    - The `regex=True` argument ensures that this replacement works even if commas appear within the string at any position.
    
    The **return value** of `replace` is a modified version of the DataFrame column (in this case, it returns the `Trading Volume` column with commas removed).
    
- **`.astype(float)` Explanation:** After replacing commas, the values are still stored as strings. The `.astype(float)` method converts these string values to float numbers. This is necessary because you can't perform numerical calculations (like summing or averaging) on strings, but you can do so on floats.
    
    Here's what happens:
    
    ```python
    stock_df['Trading Volume'] = stock_df['Trading Volume'].replace({',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)
    ```
    
    - `replace()` removes commas.
    - `.astype(float)` converts the resulting string to a float type.

This operation will **not always** occur with a float conversion after `replace`âonly when the column you're working with should be numeric and when the data contains non-numeric characters (like commas or dollar signs).

### 4. Explanation of Scaling and the `fit`/`transform` Process

- **Why use `preprocessing.StandardScaler`?**
    
    - **`StandardScaler`** is part of `sklearn.preprocessing` and is used to scale or normalize your data. Scaling ensures that all features (columns) have the same scale, meaning they have a **mean of 0** and a **standard deviation of 1**. This is important for many machine learning algorithms (especially those like linear regression, k-means, or SVM) because they are sensitive to the scale of the data.
- **`.fit()` and `.transform()`**:
    
    - `.fit()`: This method calculates the parameters needed for scaling, i.e., the mean and standard deviation of the training set (or any other data). It learns how to scale your data.
    - `.transform()`: After `fit()`, the `.transform()` method applies the scaling to the data. It uses the learned mean and standard deviation to scale the data accordingly.
- **The Workflow:**
    
    1. `fit()` is used to learn the parameters of the scaler from the **training data** (so we don't get data leakage).
    2. `transform()` is used to actually scale both the **training data** and the **test data**.
    
    ```python
    scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_train)  # Learn scaling parameters
    X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)  # Apply scaling to training data
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)  # Apply the same scaling to test data
    ```
    
- **Avoiding Data Leakage:** If you fit the scaler to the entire dataset (including the test data), the test data will influence the scaling, leading to **data leakage**. You should always **fit** the scaler only on the training set, then **transform** both the training and test sets using the same scaler.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Linear Regression Choice

- **How to decide which model to use?**
    - **Linear regression** is appropriate when there is a linear relationship between the features (independent variables) and the target (dependent variable). However, stock prices tend to be non-linear and can have complex interactions. For stock prediction, more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM for time series) might work better.
    - To determine which model to use, you can:
        1. Start with a simple model (like linear regression).
        2. Evaluate its performance.
        3. If the performance is poor, try more complex models.
- **Adjusting for accuracy with normal distribution:**
    - Linear regression returns a **mean squared error (MSE)** that assumes the errors (residuals) follow a normal distribution. To adjust the "correctness" of predictions, you could:
        
        1. Set a tolerance threshold (e.g., if the prediction is within Â±5% of the actual value, consider it correct).
        2. Use a **custom scoring function** that penalizes predictions based on how far they are from the actual values.
        3. Consider **using regression metrics** like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to better measure how close the model's predictions are to actual values.
        
        Example of MAE:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
        predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
        mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
        print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
        ```
        

If you want to make the model more flexible to allow for tolerance in the predictions, you might need to add more custom logic on top of the model's raw predictions.
